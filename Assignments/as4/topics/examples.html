		 <h2>Good Interface Design</h2><br>
		 <A HREF="http://www.polygon.com">Polygon</A><br><br>
		 <p>Polygon is one example of good interface design. Fonts are easy to read and well sized. Colors 
		 compliment each other, and sound is used appropriately. The site is also notable for its mobile interface.
		 Re-sizing your browser window creates a new, easier to use interface. This is adaptable and works on both
		 mobile and desktop interfaces.</p><br><br>
		 <A HREF="http://grantland.com/">Grantland</A><br><br>
		 <p>Grantland, a sports and entertainment commentary site, does a good job of making its content accessible and attractive to multiple devices, including smaller devices such as phones. It also does a good job of compartmentalizing its layout so that all of its content is accessible without delving into too many layers of the site (ie, minimal clicking).<br><br>
		 Finally, it utilizes images and video well, and, perhaps more importantly as much of its content contains links, features a well designed reference system that allows users to navigate and explore references without leaving the source material.</p><br>
		
		 <A HREF="http://capgeek.com/">Capgeek</A><br><br>
		 <p>Capgeek.com is a site where users can research NHL team's salary cap structure, and make 'fantasy' changes, extrapolate a given team's salary cap into the future and take a look at individual player salaries. All of these facets of the site are pretty cool, and the user interface facilitates those functions while minimizing frustration.<br><br>
		 A nice dropdown menu at the top of the site includes navigation options to the majority of the site. Less frequently accessed parts of the site, like the 'faq' and the 'about' sections are unobtrusively linked to in the upper right. The overall design of the site fits most screen sizes, and there is a well designed mobile site alternative which retains a majority of the desktop site functionality. Finally, the color scheme is aesthetically pleasing.
		 </p><br>
		 
		 <h2>Bad Interface Design</h2><br>
		 <a href="http://hfboards.hockeysfuture.com/index.php">HFBoards</a><br><br>
		 <p>HFBoards is one of the largest and most active hockey forums in existence. Unfortunately, its design is lacking in several areas. The immediate layout should be familiar to anyone who has spent time on internet message boards, but the link/menu structure is not well designed. To access the next page of topics, you have to click a small link in the top right that the design does not make readily apparent. Furthermore, advertisements are not well placed and interfere with the page flow. Finally, the color scheme is not particularly appealing, although options to customize that are available.</p><br>
