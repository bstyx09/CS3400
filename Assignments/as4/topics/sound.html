			<h1>Sound</h1><br>
			<p>Sounds are a rather important part of creating a website.<br><br> Sounds are now supported by HTML with the release of HTML5.
			Creating a user interface for sounds on a website is very important when including sounds to the website. Here are a few
			ways we can make sounds presentable and easy to use</p><br>
			<h3>Art</h3>
			<br><p>
			Creating a user interface for a website that contains sound should entail some form of art with the user interface.<br><br>
			HTML5 will create its own user interface when adding sound to a website. Here is an example of the audio player built into HTML5</p><br>
			<audio controls="controls">
			<source src="track.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
			<source src="../sounds/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
			Your browser does not support the audio element.
			</audio>
			<br>
			<p><br>
			However with the use of Javascript we can
			create our own visual objects and tools to control the use of sounds.<br><br>
			When creating our own objects on a web page it is important to ensure that all of these objects are:
			<br>- relatively close together
			<br>- visually stimulating
			<br>- easy to use
			<br>
			<br>A user should be able to easily determine where the controls are for the sound and how to control them.
			</p><br>
			<h3>Volume</h3>
			<br><p>
			Another important aspect of adding sound to a website is controlling the volume of the sounds that are played.<br><br>
			User who are listening to these sounds on the web page should also have their own means of controlling how loud the sounds are
			Generally, it is good practice to leave the sound on a lower volume setting as the page is loading. This ensures that the user
			is not blown away by the sound as the page is loaded. This also gives the user the freedom of determining if the sound is too
			quiet or too loud at their own discretion.
			</p><br>
			<h3>Cross Platform</h3>
			<br><p>
			Another main issue that arises with adding a feature such as sound to a webpage is to ensure that the sound can be played and accessed on all platforms<br>
			This means that the sounds on the webpage should work regardless of different web-browsers, different Operating Systems, and even
			different types of devices.<br><br>Generally when using the tools built into HTML5 issues with playability should not cause concern.
			<br><br>Another concern that arises with regards to cross platform compatibility is user interface consistency. This means that the 
			user interface should not have a great change when changing devices or even web browsers.
			</p><br>
			<h3>Accessibility</h3>
			<br><p>
			Accessibility in regards to a user interface generally refers to creating a user interface that is simple or easy to use.<br><br>
			One way this can be accommadated is by modifying the visual interface of the webpage. This typically means that the font sizes are larger
			to help those with poor vision. This could also mean creating more contrast with the user interface rather than using a every color
			on the color wheel; using more contrast can make a webpage appear simpler and easier to use.<br><br>
			Another way to ensure the website is more accessible is to create keyboard shortcuts for some of the controls of the site.<br><br>
			This can be done by using keys such as the spacebar or the escape key to help control the audio that is used on the site.<br>
			Other more complicated keyboard shortcuts could be used on the webpage; however these shortcuts should be displayed somewhere so 
			the user knows how to use them.
