			<h3>Mass</h3>
			<p>The sliders can be used to set the mass of the objects at the 
			end of each pendulum. The larger the total mass, the more energy the
			system will have.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Angle</h3>
			<p>The angle sliders can be used to set the initial starting position
			of the simulation. Setting angles higher will give the system more energy.
			</p><br>
			
			<h3>Trail Type</h3>
			<p>The trail type buttons can be used to set the type of trail. A full trail 
			will show the entire path of the circle objects. A comet trail will have the tail disappear
			as the front of the trail is built. This gives it the appearance similar to that of a shooting star.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Show/Hide</h3>
			<p>Using the check boxes, one can show or hide any of the options on the screen. One can hide lines,
			trails, or circles.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Saving and Loading Files</h3>
			<p>To save a file, enter a file name (as *.txt) in the box. Click save Text to File and a text file
			will download with the angle and mass values saved. Click choose file to find a previously downloaded file.
			Once that file is chosen, click load selected file and the sliders will be set to the values in the file.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Energy Graphs</h3>
			<p>There are three graphs of energy on the page, P, K, and T. P stands for potential energy, the energy stored 
			in an object due to its position in a system due to its configuration. K stands for Kinetic energy, the energy an 
			object possesses due to its motion. T is total energy, the measure of combined potential and kinetic energy.</p><br>
