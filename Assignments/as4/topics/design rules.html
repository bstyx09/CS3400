			<h1>Interface Design Rules</h1><br>
			<p>When creating a user interface there are number of useful rules as outlined by Ben Shneiderman. These rules help to create a website that is useful and also more user friendly.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Strive for Consistency</h3><br>
			<p>Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology 
			should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent commands should be employed throughout.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Enable frequent users to use shortcuts</h3><br>
			<p>As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to reduce the number of interactions and to increase the pace of interaction. 
			Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to an expert user.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Offer Informative Feedback</h3><br>
			<p>For every operator action, there should be some system feedback. For frequent and minor actions, the response can be modest, 
			while for infrequent and major actions, the response should be more substantial.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Design Dialog to Yield Closure</h3><br>
			<p>Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. The informative feedback at the completion of
			a group of actions gives the operators the satisfaction of accomplishment, a sense of relief, the signal to drop contingency 
			plans and options from their minds, and an indication that the way is clear to prepare for the next group of actions.</p><br>
			
			<h3>Offer Simple Error Handling</h3><br>
			<p>The user interface should be designed in a way that the user cannot make a serious error. If any error does occur, the system should be able to 
			detect the error and recover from the error.
			</p><br>
			
			<h3>Permit Easy Reversal of Actions</h3><br>
			<p>The user interface should allow the user to undo a previous action. This helps to relieve anxiety for the user because it allows the user to undo 
			any action that may have been performed in error. This also helps to encourage users to explore new actions.
			</p><br>
			
			<h3>Support Internal Locus of Control</h3><br>
			<p>The user interface should be designed to make the users the initiators of actions rather than the responders of actions. This helps the users to feel
			that they are in control of the system and that the system responds to their actions.
			</p><br>
			
			<h3>Reduce Short-term Memory Load</h3><br>
			<p>Displays should be kept simple because of the limits of human short-term memory. Multiple pages should be consolidated, window-motion frequency should be reduced
			and sufficient training time should be allotted for codes, mnemonics, and sequences of actions.
