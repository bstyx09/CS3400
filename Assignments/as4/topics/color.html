		 <h1>Colors and the User Interface</h1>
		 <br>
		 <p>
		 Color is a very important part of a user interface. Colors can help make a dull topic pleasing to read and could also be the icing on the cake for an engaging topic.<br><br>
		 </p>
		 <h3>Art</h3>
		 <p>When adding colors to a webpage it is important to use colors that work well with the content of the page.<br><br>
		 This could mean picking colors that work with everything from the images on a webpage to even the videos used on the webpage.
		 Picking colors that work well with these objects can mean the difference between a magnificent blend of colors to a sad clash
		 of a mess of colors.<br>It is important that the colors and the content of the page work well with each other.</p>
		 <br><h3>Color Wheel</h3>
		 <br><p>
		 The color wheel is a useful tool for deciding what colors should be used on a website. The three primary colors of the color wheel are blue, red, and yellow.
		 These colors clash together however, the colors directly across from these colors on the color wheel do match each of these colors.<br>
		 <br>Here is an example of the color wheel
		 </p><br>
		 <img src="../images/colorwheel.jpg" alt="Color Wheel">
		 <p><br>For example, the color blue matches with orange and is directly across from orange on the color wheel. Red matches with Green and is directly across from green
		 on the color wheel. Yellow matches with violet and is directly across from violet on the color wheel.<br><br>
		 When choosing matching colors for a user interface the color wheel can be invaluable tool<br></p>
		 <br><h3>Recommended palletes</h3><br>
		 <p>
		 There are a few color palletes that are more common.<br><br>
		 The most common color pallete is black and white. This color pallete offers a high contrast ratio and helps to keep the content easy to use. This is the simplest of color 
		 palletes. Even though this pallete is not particularly engaging; it helps keep the focus on the message rather than the color.<br>
		 Other useful color palletes can be derived from the color wheel by choosing a primary color and its matching color. One can then add more colors to this pallete by adding
		 more shades of these colors and black and white. When doing this it can be more desirable to choose either dark shades or lighter shades of these colors rather than mixing
		 and matching too much contrast between these shades.
		 </p><br>
		 <br><h3>Cross Platform</h3><br>
		 <p>
		 Another main factor in choosing colors for a user interface is to account for different types of screens the interface is used for.<br><br>
		 There are many different monitors and screens that can be used to view a webpage. Many colors can be seen differently on different types of screens.
		 Differences in type of monitor and even the backlighting of the screen can affect the color output of a user interface. It can be nearly
		 impossible to account for these discrepencies. However, it is important to ensure that these colors work well on the devices that the user interface
		 is more commonly used on.
		 </p><br>
		 <br><h3>Accessibility</h3><br>
		 <p>
		 When adding color to a website it is important to retain visibility of important aspects of an interface.<br><br>
		 Adding too much color can detract from the meaning of certain elements of the user interface. Retaining contrast of the more important 
		 objects of the site helps to keep the focus of the viewer on the message of the object.<br><br>
		 Using colors with higher contrast such as black and white can help to make the interface easy to read. The more contrast between colors helps to add distinction between 
		 different elements of the interface.
